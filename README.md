## üìñ Overview  
**[Download Full Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03696)**  
This repository provides implementations of **attribute encoding techniques** and **LSTM-based HyperModels** for outcome-oriented predictive business process monitoring. The models support multiple scenario setups, including:  

- Handling **both balanced and imbalanced datasets**.  
- Utilizing **pseudo-embedding matrices** for duration and feature correlations.  
- Supporting **hierarchical inputs** for sequence and event attributes.  
- Accommodating **simultaneous event inputs**.  

The framework is designed for flexibility and performance across diverse predictive process monitoring tasks.
