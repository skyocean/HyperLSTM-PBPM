# Comprehensive Attribute Encoding and Dynamic LSTM HyperModels for Predictive Business Process Monitoring

**Authors**: Fang Wang (Florence Wong), Paolo Ceravolo, Ernesto Damiani  
**Repository**: Code and Demos for the associated research article.

---

## üìñ Overview  
This repository contains implementations of **attribute encoding techniques** and **LSTM-based HyperModels** for outcome-oriented predictive business process monitoring. The models support both **balanced and imbalanced datasets**, with dynamic embeddings for duration, feature correlations, and text data.
